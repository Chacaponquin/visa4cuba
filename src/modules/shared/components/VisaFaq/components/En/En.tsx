        A tourist visa allows you to enter and stay in Cuba for up to 30 days.
        It can be extended once for an additional 30 days at an immigration
        office by paying a fee.

      >
        Before boarding your flight, you must show your tourist visa at the
        airport check-in counter. Upon arrival in Cuba, immigration officers
        will stamp it. You must then keep it with you during your stay and
        present it when checking in at hotels or casas particulares. It must be
        returned at the airport upon departure.

      <FaqCard icon={Time} title="How long should I keep my tourist visa?">
